# InverseModulus

    Recall that a value a has an inverse mod n iff a is relatively prime to n.
    Compute the multiplicative inverses for the values 1 to 34 mod 35.
    I suggest writing a small program to do this.
    
    We have not discussed the extended Euclidean algorithm,
    which is the usual way of finding inverse, so it's fine for each a to try all possible values to find its inverse.
    Put your results in a table containing only those values that do have inverses along with the inverses.
